<p align="left"> Hello stranger! I'm an engineer fascinated by technology, innovation, and sustainability. I believe these areas are largely responsible for propelling our world towards sustainable development and improving life quality. In this way, I have been performing my work in related areas - such as urban mobility, electric vehicles, and renewable energy. Today, I am creating solutions to improve electric buses' feasibility and penetration in urban environments. My research focuses on mobility, optimization, and artificial intelligence. </p>

<summary><h3> 🧑🏻‍💻 My full journey </h3></summary>

 My name is Jônatas Manzolli and I'm a PhD student in Sustainable Energy Systems at the University of Coimbra.
 
🤓 I hold an MSc degree in Energy for Sustainability and a BS degree in Electrical Engineering. During my undergraduate period, I had the opportunity to be an exchange student at the Technical University of Munich, thanks to a scholarship from CsF/DAAD.

🏆 As a result of my research in electrical mobility, I received the SYLFF award for young world leaders in 2019 and was selected to participate in the International Workshop on Innovating (IWI) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests include fast charging techniques, route optimization, urban mobility, and electric vehicles in general.
 
🚗🔋 I have also been recognized for my work, being placed among the top ten best projects in the EDP University Challenge award and being a finalist in the Oeiras Valley Award. I have also worked at the company IAV Automotive Engineering in Munich, Germany during 2015-2016 and am currently a fellow researcher at the Institute for Systems Engineering and Computers at Coimbra (INESCC).
 
 
📝 Feel free to take a look at my projects and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
 
 🌍 Let's make the world a better place together!
